    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm. It quantifies the amount of time an algorithm takes to run based on the size of its input. Efficient algorithms have low time complexity, meaning they can solve problems quickly, even as the input size increases.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> is another critical consideration when analyzing algorithms. It represents the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to solve a problem based on its input size. When we say an algorithm has a <b>Space Complexity of O(n)</b>, it means the space used by the algorithm grows linearly with the size of the input data. Managing space efficiently is essential in optimizing memory usage in software applications.
